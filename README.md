# GBTileBreaker

This is a fast-coded utility to help me in the process of ripping fonts from old GB cartridges. Save the tiles from Visual Boy Advance and run this utility as follows:

> python gbtb.py path_to_image_file 

It runs on Pillow, the dependencies are specified via pipenv, so it should be fairly easy to make this work on your local computer.
